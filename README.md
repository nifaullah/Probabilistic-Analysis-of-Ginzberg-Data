# Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Ginzberg-Data
Academic Project

Data: Ginzberg dataset in-built in library Cardata

Approach: First we try to approximately find a set of candidate distribution and afterwards we run a series of test to find the most appropriate distribution for the data. \

Goal: To find the most appropriate distribution corresponding to the Ginzberg data

Language: R

Major Findings: Data follows Gamma distribution.\

Acknowledgement: This analysis was done as a part of requirement for BANA 7031 course at Carl H. Lindner College of Business in the university of Cincinnati
